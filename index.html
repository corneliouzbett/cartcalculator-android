<p>Cart Calculator for Android is as simple as it sounds: it replaces the ordnary device's calculator for when you are at the grocery store or at the market, giving you the option to manage your shopping cart by adding products and increasing or decreasing their quantities.</p>

<p>At any time, the Cart Calculator displays the total due of the products in your cart based on their prices and quantities. You'll always be aware of how much you're spending even before reaching the checkout. This is specially useful for when you absolutely has to go shopping but has litte money, or when you're at the end of the month and on a budget.</p>

<p>Using Cart Calculator to manage your shoppings is very easy and designed to be straight forward:</p>

<li>Press the "Add item" button to add a new product to your cart. You inform its name and price and then click on the "Add" button.</li>
<li>If you want to add another product of the same kind - that is, increase its quantity in the cart -, simply find it in the list and press the "+ (plus)" button. Likewise, if you want to take away some of this product, just hit the "- (less)" button.</li>
<li>To remove a product from the list, simply drop its quantity to zero.</li>
<li>All the time, the amount of money due to payent is shown in the Home screen, updated for every change you did</li>
</ul><h3>
